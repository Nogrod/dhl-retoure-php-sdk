/**
 * Parcel DE Returns API
 *
 * # Introduction ## Overview                  Note:   This is the specification of the DP-DHL Group Parcel DE Returns API. This web service allows business customers to create return labels on demand.  # Scenarios ## Main Scenario: Creating a returnlabel This is achieved by posting a return order to the URI '/rest/orders'. The service will respond with a return label. ## Querying to get receiver locations The single scenario supported by this service is the determination of the receiver's location. This is achieved by getting a location to the URI '/rest/locations'. The service will respond with a Receiver. # Technical Note on Authorization This API supports __two alternative ways__ to authorize yourself: 1. Combination of Apikey and Basic Authentication which you can provide with every call. 2. OAuth2 Password Flow: After having obtained your access token once, you provide this token as bearer token.   You can try it out here. More details can be found when clicking on \"Authorize\".
